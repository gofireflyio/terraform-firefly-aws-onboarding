### Multi Account Installation with Stackset

```hcl-terraform
module "firefly-auth" {
  source                = "github.com/gofireflyio/terraform-firefly-aws-onboarding?ref=v2.14.0/modules/firefly_auth"
  firefly_access_key    = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
  firefly_secret_key    = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
}

module "firefly" {
  source      = "github.com/gofireflyio/terraform-firefly-aws-onboarding?ref=v2.14.0"
  firefly_token = module.firefly-auth.firefly_token
  production  = true
  external_id = "YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID"
  event_driven_regions = [
    "us-east-1", "us-east-2", "us-west-1", "us-west-2", "af-south-1", "ap-east-1", "ap-south-1", "ap-south-2",
    "ap-southeast-1", "ap-southeast-2", "ap-southeast-3", "ap-northeast-1", "ap-northeast-2", "ap-northeast-3",
    "ca-central-1", "cn-north-1", "cn-northwest-1", "eu-central-1", "eu-west-1", "eu-west-2", "eu-west-3", "eu-south-1",
    "eu-south-2", "eu-north-1", "me-south-1", "me-central-1", "sa-east-1", "il-central-1"
  ]
  # Read Debugging Section Below
  # debug = true
  
  stackset        = true
  region          = "us-east-1"
  org_ou_ids      = ["ou-...", "ou-..."]
} 
```
### Multi Account (optional):  Additional OU with Stackset Instance
usable when you wish to deploy an **_ou_** with a dedicated instance.
```hcl-terraform
# OPTIONAL: additional ou ids with seperate stackset_instance
resource "aws_cloudformation_stack_set_instance" "ou-id-0" {
  deployment_targets {
      organizational_unit_ids = ["ou-id-0"]
  }
  # must match the same region as the Stackset
  region         = "us-east-1"
  # choose your preferred operation preferences
  operation_preferences {
    max_concurrent_count    = 10
    failure_tolerance_count = 10
    concurrency_mode        = "SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"
  }
  stack_set_name = module.firefly.stack_set_name
}
```
### Single Account Installation 

```hcl-terraform
module "firefly_auth" {
  source = "github.com/gofireflyio/terraform-firefly-aws-onboarding?ref=v2.14.0/modules/firefly_auth"
  firefly_access_key    = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
  firefly_secret_key    = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
}

module "firefly-read-only" {
  source                = "github.com/gofireflyio/terraform-firefly-aws-onboarding?ref=v2.14.0"
  firefly_token         = module.firefly_auth.firefly_token
  name                  = "INTEGRATION_NAME"
  external_id           = "YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID"
  production            = true
  event_driven_regions  = ["us-east-1","us-east-2","us-west-1","us-west-2","af-south-1","ap-east-1","ap-south-1","ap-southeast-1","ap-southeast-2","ap-northeast-1","ap-northeast-2","ap-northeast-3","ca-central-1","cn-north-1","cn-northwest-1","eu-central-1","eu-west-1","eu-west-2","eu-west-3","eu-south-1","eu-north-1","me-south-1","sa-east-1"]
  # Read Debugging Section Below
  # debug = true
}
```

### Debugging - Integrations - response outputs
```hcl-terraform
# add debug = true to the existing module
module "firefly" {
  source      = "github.com/gofireflyio/terraform-firefly-aws-onboarding?ref=v2.14.0"  
  debug       = true
}

output "integration_responses" {
  value = module.firefly.integration_responses
}
# share the output with Firefly support 
```

### Upgrading to from v1.y.z to v2.y.z
Use of `devops-rob/terracurl` provider is removed in favour of official `hashicorp/http`
Prior to upgrading it is required to remove the deprecated resources from the state eg:
```
terraform state list | grep terracurl_request

module.firefly.module.firefly_aws_integration[0].terracurl_request.firefly_aws_integration_request
```
```
terraform state rm "module.firefly.module.firefly_aws_integration[0].terracurl_request.firefly_aws_integration_request"

Removed module.firefly.module.firefly_aws_integration[0].terracurl_request.firefly_aws_integration_request
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```


### Optional
You can optionally add tags to each relevant resource:
```
tags = {
  project: "zeus"
}
```

You can optionally add a prefix to all created resource:
```
resource_prefix = "prod-"
```
